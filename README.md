GroupDrive is an android app designated for users wanting to search and join trips.
Also, trip instructors can create and post their coming trips.

Besides planning and registering for trips, the GroupDrive app also allows users
to view a navigation map where they can see all the other group members and communicate with them.

This app is developed with Java, using Retrofit as the HTTP client library.
The backend is Flask with MongoDB.
